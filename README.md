TASK 3:
  To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an
interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize
CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and
loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be
done with basic knowledge of these technologies..


Just pushed my latest project â€“ a basic calculator crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸ§®ðŸ’» The code features an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with a display screen for user input and results. Embraced the CSS grid system for seamless button alignments. Dive into the codebase to explore the implementation of event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops, making it an excellent learning experience for those getting started with web development. Contributions and feedback are more than welcome! Let's code together! 

HTML:
"I structured the HTML of the calculator project to provide a solid foundation for user interaction. The layout includes a display screen element, where users can see their input and calculation results in real-time. Additionally, I created buttons for each digit and mathematical operation, ensuring a clear and accessible interface. The HTML serves as the backbone, defining the structure and elements that make up the calculator's user interface."

CSS:
"The CSS portion of the project was dedicated to styling and layout, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the calculator. I employed the CSS grid system to meticulously arrange the buttons in a clean and organized manner, ensuring a seamless user experience. The stylesheet defines the color scheme, fonts, and overall aesthetic, creating a visually cohesive design that complements the functionality provided by the HTML and JavaScript."

JavaScript:
"To imbue the calculator with dynamic functionality, I utilized JavaScript to handle user input and perform calculations. Event listeners were implemented to capture button clicks, while if-else statements allowed the program to discern the selected mathematical operation. Operators and loops were employed to execute precise calculations, ensuring accuracy in the results displayed on the screen. JavaScript was crucial in making the calculator interactive and responsive to user actions, providing a seamless and efficient user experience."
